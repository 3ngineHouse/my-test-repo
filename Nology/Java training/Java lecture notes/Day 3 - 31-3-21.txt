A UTILITY class is a class that only contains static methods

It is "stateless" - it holds no information that than be changed

It is purely a holder for methods that perform operations useful elsewhere in the application


The four pillars of object oriented programming:

Abstraction
Encapsulation  -  classes are a big part of this
Inheritance
Polymorphism


"alt + insert" opens the generate menu in a class, allowing a constructor to be created

Multiple items can be selected using shift in the menu that follows

This can also create getters and setters


The @Override annotation means that a method you write replaces a default method of the same name

It's often used with toString


Instance method = acts on one instance of a class (tends to use this.[variable])

Static method = acts on all instances of a class


If you give a variable in a class a value when you declare it, this will be the default value

If you instantiate the class and don't give that variable a value, it will use the default
