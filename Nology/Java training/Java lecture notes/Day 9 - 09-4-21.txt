HashMaps don't allow duplicate keys

The put() method will, if given an existing key, overwrite that entry

If the given key DOESN'T exist, a new entry will be created


.getOrDefault() is superior to .get()

it takes a second argument after the key, that is returned if the key isn't present

This second argument HAS to be a String, regardless of the value type of the hashMap calling it


You can't use a for each loop directly on a HashMap (unless you use "HashSets"?)
