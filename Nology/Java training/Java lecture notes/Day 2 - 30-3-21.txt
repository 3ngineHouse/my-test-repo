Java methods are typed - you say what you'll pass them, and what they'll return

Don't define a variable just to return it - common "antipattern"

You can make two versions of a method with the same name, differentiated only by the arguments they accept e.g. findArea(length, width) and findArea(radius)

shift-shift in main method and typing "new class" is the shortcut to creating a new class


If you put a bunch of methods in a seperate class (BasicMethods, for example), use:

	import static com.nology.BasicMethods.*;


Class are named in PascalCase, variables are named in camelCase


Arrays are not resizable, Arraylists are


Using the "debug" command rather than the "run" command is how break points (red dots, created by clicking a line number) are inspected.

The program will pause and show you the state of all variables just BEFORE the break-point line is executed.

Click "step over" (on the bar along the top of the debugger) to see the state of the variables just AFTER the break point line is executed.
