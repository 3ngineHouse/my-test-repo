"Java is a back-end language"

Java is a compiled language, Javascript is an interpreted language

JDK contains "everything we need to write java code", including:

	the JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

	the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

"sout -> enter" is a shortcut for System.out.println();

"[variable].sout -> enter" wraps a variable in a System.out statement


Functional programming VS object orientated programming

	two paradigms, each with their pros and cons


In a java program, there is ALWAYS a Main class containing a main method
All other classes branch out from this


Double is more precise than float - always use double unless you have a complex reason not to

"Bust a variable" = put a value into a variable that's too large for it to hold


Reference type = a data type based on a class rather than a primitive type (e.g. string)


USEFUL CODE SNIPPETS

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String input = scanner.next();


int RandomInteger = (int) Math.ceil(Math.random()*maxPossibleResult);


double BMI = weight / ((height/100) * (height/100));
DecimalFormat roundedResult = new DecimalFormat("#.#");
System.out.println("Your BMI is: "+roundedResult.format(BMI)+"\n");

NOTE:	DecimalFormat("#.##") will round to two decimal places, but WON'T pad
	DecimalFormat("0.00") will round to two decimal places and WILL pad
