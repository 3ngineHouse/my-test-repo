TODAY & TOMORROW

ArrayLists - a collection of values (that can be duplicated), in a defined ORDER

Hashmaps - a collection of unique keys, each with a corresponding value (values can be duplicated)

HashSets - a collection of unique values

Neither HashMaps nor HashSets have a concept of the positions of elements, unlike an ArrayList


Streams & Lambda Expressions

.stream() starts to stream a collection

Intermediate methods are chained together in the middle of the stream

Terminal methods end the stream

POKER CHALLENGE


%10.20s says format a String, taking at least 10 characters, and at most 20 characters. This will pad short strings to 10, and truncate long strings to 20 chars.

To line up columns in a series of sout statements, the numbers before and after the . in String formats should be the same. For example, %-20.20s.
